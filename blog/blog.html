                        <p>An imposing white monument, Victoria Memorial is one of the most visited places in Kolkata, and for all good reasons. Named after Queen Victoria, it now serves as a museum and is perfect for history buffs. If you ever feel like taking a walk down our past and reflect on how long India has come from its colonization days, visit this place. There are light and sound shows held in the evening. The era of India’s freedom struggle is shown not only through the light and sound show but through a series of paintings, artifacts, sculptures and books. We would recommend spending at least 3-4 hours to gain knowledge about our country’s past.</p>

                        <p>The temple is dedicated to Bhavatarani, an aspect of Goddess Kali and ‘the savior of the universe’. One of the oldest and most important temples to have ever been built, it receives pilgrims from all over the world.

                            The temple was founded by Rani Rashmoni, who lost her husband and was left with a vast amount of wealth. The idea of building this temple came to her in a dream and this was the last thing she did before going on a pilgrimage to Varanasi.</p>
